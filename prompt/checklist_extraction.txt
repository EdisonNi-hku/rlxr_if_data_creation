# Task Description
You are a professional instruction analysis expert. You need to extract all possible checklist items and constraints that could affect the evaluation of a future response, based solely on the given [Instruction].

You should use the [Constraint System] below as a *reference framework* for identifying and categorizing potential constraints. However, the Constraint System is NOT exhaustive. There may be additional constraints that fall outside of this system. You must still extract them if they are implied or stated in the instruction.

Your output should be as detailed as possible. Use numerical numbering and "\n" to list all points in the checklist.

# Constraint System
