Prompt Template for Constraint Extraction from Instruction

# Task Description
You are a professional instruction analysis expert. You need to extract all possible checklist items and constraints that could affect the evaluation of a future response, based solely on the given [Instruction].

You should use the [Constraint System] below as a *reference framework* for identifying and categorizing potential constraints. However, the Constraint System is NOT exhaustive. There may be additional constraints that fall outside of this system. You must still extract them if they are implied or stated in the instruction.

Your output should be as detailed as possible. Use numerical numbering and "\n" to list all points in the checklist.

# Constraint System
1. Lexical content constraint: Mandatory use of specific terms or symbols, including their inclusion and precise placement. Example: *...must include the word "[Specific Word]" in the final sentence.*
2. Element content constraint: Mandates for including specific elements or concepts in responses, reflecting a scenario or object. Example: *...the story must feature a [Specific Object/Character].*
3. Semantic content constraint: Directives on thematic content, perspective, or tone, emphasizing response significance. Example: *Write a story about the concept of [Abstract Theme, e.g., Betrayal].*
4. Tone and emotion stylistic constraint: The emotional tone must adhere to standards such as seriousness, anger, joy, humor, and politeness. Example: *Write the passage in a [Specific Emotion, e.g., Melancholic] tone.*
5. Form and style stylistic constraint: Text expression standards ensure alignment with specific stylistic criteria in both presentation and perception. Example: *Write a passage in the style of [Specific Genre, e.g., Film Noir].*
6. Audience-specific stylistic constraint: Text should be tailored to specific audiences, ensuring clarity and relevance for specialized groups. Example: *Explain this narrative to a [Specific Audience, e.g., 5-year-old].*
7. Authorial style stylistic constraint: Texts should emulate the styles of known authors to achieve artistic effects or depth. Example: *Write a passage in the style of [Famous Author].*
8. Pragmatic linguistic constraint: Contextual language study, encompassing speech acts, implicature, discourse, dialects, sociolects, and language policy. Example: *The dialogue must use [Specific Dialect/Slang] appropriate for the setting.*
9. Syntactic linguistic constraint: Sentence structure, including phrases, constituents, subordinate clauses, and imperatives. Example: *Write using only [Specific Sentence Structure, e.g., simple sentences].*
10. Morphological linguistic constraint: The internal structure and formation rules of words, including roots, affixes, and morphological changes. Example: *Use words that contain the prefix "[Prefix]" whenever possible.*
11. Phonological linguistic constraint: Study on phonological structures: phonemes, allophones, pitch, duration, and intensity. Example: *The text must follow an AABB rhyme scheme.*
12. Role-based situation constraint: Simulating characters based on context, emulating their traits, language, and behaviors. Example: *You are [Character Persona]; write your response from this perspective.*
13. Inverse constraint: Narrow the response space through inverse constraints and indirect exclusion. Example: *Describe [Object] without using the words [Forbidden Word 1] or [Forbidden Word 2].*
14. Alphabetical sequence constraint: Sentences must begin with sequential letters of the alphabet (A-Z). Example: *The first sentence must start with 'A', the second with 'B', and so on.*
15. Monosyllabic constraint: The text must be composed entirely of words with a single syllable. Example: *Write a response using only one-syllable words.*
16. Lipogram constraint: A specific, usually common letter is strictly forbidden from appearing anywhere in the text. Example: *Write a response without using the letter "[Letter]".*
17. Anadiplosis constraint: The last word of a sentence must be the exact first word of the following sentence. Example: *Ensure the last word of every sentence matches the first word of the next sentence.*
18. Incremental sentence constraint: The word count of each sentence must increase by exactly one word sequentially (1, 2, 3...). Example: *Sentence 1 must have 1 word, Sentence 2 must have 2 words, etc.*
19. Circular narrative constraint: The very first sentence and the very last sentence of the text must be identical. Example: *Start and end the text with the exact phrase: "[Specific Phrase]."*
20. Uniform punctuation constraint: Every sentence in the text must end with the same specific punctuation mark. Example: *Every sentence must end with a [Punctuation Mark].*
21. Lexical length constraint: All words used in the text must be under or exactly at a specific character limit. Example: *Do not use any words longer than [Number] letters.*
22. Dialogue-only constraint: The text must rely exclusively on spoken dialogue, with absolutely no narration or speech tags. Example: *Write the scene using only dialogue lines, with no descriptive text.*
23. Acrostic constraint: The first letter of each sentence must spell out a specific hidden word or message vertically. Example: *The first letters of the sentences must spell the word "[Hidden Word]".*
24. Tautogram constraint: All words in the text must start with the same letter. Example: *Every word in the response must start with the letter "[Letter]".*
25. Univocalic constraint: The text must use only one specific vowel type throughout, excluding all others. Example: *Write using only the vowel "[Vowel]" (e.g., 'e') and no others.*
26. Unreliable Narrator constraint: The narrator must clearly display bias, ignorance, or deceit, contradicting themselves or known facts. Example: *Write from the perspective of a narrator who is clearly lying about [Event].*
27. In Media Res constraint: The narrative must begin immediately in the middle of intense action, with no opening exposition. Example: *Start the story in the middle of [Action Sequence] without explaining the context.*
28. Genre Mashup constraint: The story must combine specific tropes from two traditionally clashing genres. Example: *Combine elements of [Genre A] and [Genre B] in a single scene.*
29. Dramatic Irony constraint: The text must establish a scenario where the reader clearly knows a critical fact that the character does not. Example: *Write a scene where the reader knows [Specific Fact], but the character acts as if they do not.*
30. Extended Metaphor constraint: A single specific metaphor must be introduced early and used consistently to describe the subject throughout. Example: *Describe [Topic A] using only metaphors and terminology related to [Topic B].*
31. Chekhov’s Gun constraint: A specific, seemingly insignificant object mentioned at the start must be the essential tool for resolution at the end. Example: *Introduce [Small Object] in the first sentence and use it to resolve the conflict in the final sentence.*
32. Synesthetic Imagery constraint: Descriptions must intentionally cross sensory domains, describing one sense using the vocabulary of another. Example: *Describe the sound of [Sound Source] using words usually reserved for [Different Sense, e.g., Taste].*
33. Stream of Consciousness constraint: The narrative flow must mimic raw thought processes, characterized by loose associations and run-on sentences. Example: *Write the internal monologue of the character using a stream-of-consciousness style.*
34. Narrative Arc reversal constraint: The emotional tone of the story must strictly travel from one extreme to its opposite. Example: *Start the narrative with a feeling of [Emotion A] and end it with a feeling of [Emotion B].*
35. Breaking the Fourth Wall constraint: The narrator must explicitly address the reader or acknowledge that they are in a story. Example: *The narrator must speak directly to the reader about [Topic].*
