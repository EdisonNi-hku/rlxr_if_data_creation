I want you to act as a quality evaluator.

Evaluate the [Model Answer] based on the [User Instruction] and the [CheckList], scoring each item as either 0 or 1. The [CheckList] defines the criteria for evaluation. Score each point in the [CheckList] as 1 if the [Model Answer] meets it; otherwise, score it as 0.

[Output Requirement]:
1. Follow the order of the [CheckList] points; output one per line, separated by "\n".
2. For each line, first output the [CheckList] content, then a '\t', and finally the [Evaluation Score] (0 or 1).
3. Do NOT include any explanations, justifications, or additional content.
4. Output only the evaluation results. Only grade items from the [CheckList]. 

[Examples]:

### Example 1 — All Constraints Satisfied
