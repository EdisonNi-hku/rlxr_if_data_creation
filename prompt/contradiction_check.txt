[Task Description]
You are a professional instruction-analysis annotator. Your task is to determine whether a given prompt contains any **self-contradictory constraints**.

A **constraint** is any explicit or implicit requirement that restricts, shapes, or governs how a response must be generated. Constraints can apply to content, style, structure, language, logic, format, or narrative behavior. A prompt may contain multiple constraints at once.

Below are representative types of constraints you may encounter:

1. Lexical content constraints  
   These require specific words, phrases, symbols, or placements.  
   Example: “The final sentence must contain the word ‘inevitable’.”

2. Element content constraints  
   These require the inclusion of specific objects, characters, or concepts.  
   Example: “The story must include a talking clock and a lost astronaut.”

3. Semantic content constraints  
   These define themes, perspectives, or abstract goals.  
   Example: “Write about betrayal from the villain’s perspective.”

4. Tone and emotion constraints  
   These require a specific emotional tone.  
   Example: “Write in a melancholic and hopeless tone.”

5. Form and style constraints  
   These impose genre, format, or stylistic rules.  
   Example: “Write in the style of a legal contract.”

6. Audience-specific constraints  
   These tailor the text to a particular audience.  
   Example: “Explain this to a 5-year-old.”

7. Authorial style constraints  
   These require imitation of a known author or persona.  
   Example: “Write in the style of Franz Kafka.”

8. Linguistic constraints (syntactic, morphological, phonological)  
   These restrict grammar, word forms, or sound patterns.  
   Examples:
   - “Use only simple sentences.”
   - “Every word must begin with the letter S.”
   - “Use an AABB rhyme scheme.”

9. Structural or formal constraints  
   These affect ordering, length, repetition, or layout.  
   Examples:
   - “Each sentence must increase by one word.”
   - “The first and last sentence must be identical.”

10. Inverse or exclusion constraints  
    These forbid specific words, letters, or concepts.  
    Example: “Do not use the letter ‘e’ anywhere in the text.”

11. Narrative logic constraints  
    These affect plot, narrator reliability, or information flow.  
    Examples:
    - “The narrator must be unreliable.”
    - “Begin in the middle of the action.”
    - “The reader must know a secret the character does not.”

12. Meta or pragmatic constraints  
    These affect how the model should behave or structure its response.  
    Example: “Do not explain your reasoning. Output only the final answer.”

[Your Task]

You will be given a prompt that contains one or more constraints. Your job is to label whether the prompt contains **self-contradiction**.

A prompt is considered **self-contradictory** if:
- Two or more constraints cannot logically be satisfied at the same time.
- One constraint directly negates or nullifies another.
- The instructions require mutually exclusive formats, tones, or structures.
- Fulfilling one constraint would necessarily violate another.

Examples of contradictions:
- “Write only in dialogue” + “Include detailed narration.”
- “Do not use the letter ‘e’” + “End the story with the word ‘the’.”
- “Each sentence must have exactly 3 words” + “Each sentence must increase in length.”
- “Write for a 5-year-old” + “Use advanced legal jargon throughout.”

Non-contradictory prompts may be difficult, unusual, or highly constrained—but still logically possible.

[Labeling Instructions]

Given a prompt, output:

1. A binary label:
   - "Contradictory"
   - "Not Contradictory"

2. A short justification (2–5 sentences) explaining your decision.
